Binomial is a package that provides functions for binomial distributions.

bin_choose() calculates the number of combinations in which k successes can occur in n trials.

bin_probability() calculates the probability in which k successes can occur in n trials with the probability of success.

bin_distribution() calculates the binomial distribution with an output as a data frame with class "bindis","data.frame". plot() method for a binomial distribution creates a barplot.

bin_cumulative() calculates the cumulative probability of a binomial distribution. The output is a data frame with class "bincum","data.frame". plot() function gives you a line plot of the cumulative distribution.

bin_variable() gives the binomial variable with class "binvar". It prints out the parameters. summary() functions gives you a summary of the variable: mean, variable, mode, skewness, kurtosis.

bin_mean() calculates mean of binomial distributions.

bin_variance() calculates variance of binomial.

bin_mode() calculates mode of binomial distributions.

bin_skewness() calculates skewness of binomial distributions.

bin_kurtosis() calculates kurtosis of binomial distributions
